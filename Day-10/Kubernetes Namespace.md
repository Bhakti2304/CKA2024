# Kubernetes Namespaces

- In Kubernetes, a namespace is a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users.  They provide a mechanism for isolating resources such as services, pods, and deployments within the same cluster.

## Common Use Cases for Namespaces
- **Separation of environments**: Separate namespaces for development, testing, and production.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Different teams or projects can have their own namespaces to ensure isolation.
