## Requests and Limits

- Requests: This is the minimum amount of resources a pod needs to operate smoothly. Think of it as a guaranteed reservation for the pod.
- Limits: This is the maximum amount of resources a pod can use. It acts as a safety cap to prevent any pod from consuming more than its fair share and disrupting others.
