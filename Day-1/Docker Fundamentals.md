# Docker Fundamentals

## What is Docker?
- Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
- Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
- This ensures that the application will run on any other machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.
