## Static pods, Manual scheduling, Labels, and Selectors in Kubernetes

Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet on a specific node rather than being managed by the Kubernetes API server.

### Key Characteristics of Static Pods:
- **Not Managed by the Scheduler**: Unlike deployments or replicasets, the Kubernetes scheduler does not manage static pods.
- **Defined on the Node**: Configuration files for static pods are placed directly on the node's file system, and the `kubelet` watches these files.
- **Some examples of static pods are:** ApiServer, Kube-scheduler, controller-manager, ETCD etc
  
### Managing Static Pods:
1. **SSH into the Node**: You will gain access to the node where the static pod is defined.(Mostly the control plane node)
2. **Modify the YAML File**: Edit or create the YAML configuration file for the static pod.
3. **Remove the Scheduler YAML**: To stop the pod, you must remove or modify the corresponding file directly on the node.
4. **Default location**": is usually `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`; you can place the pod YAML in the directory, and Kubelet will pick it for scheduling.
