## Why Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that schedules and automates the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications (microservices).
- Kubernetes services provide load-balancing and simplify container management  on multiple hosts.

### Benefits: 

1. Kubernetes automatically provisions and fits containers into nodes. Kubernetes container's orchestration avoids repetitive processes and inefficient administration with fewer servers.
2. Kubernetes clusters allow the simple and accelerated migration of containerized applications from on-premises infrastructure to hybrid deployments across any cloud provider’s public cloud or private cloud infrastructure without losing any of an app’s functions or performance.
3. Kubernetes services let you grow without needing to rearchitect your infrastructure. Hosting four apps on four virtual machines would generally require four copies of a guest OS to run on that server. Running those four apps in a container approach,though, means containing all of them within a single container where they share one version of the host OS.
4. Kubernetes schedules and automates container deployment across multiple compute nodes, whether on the public cloud, onsite VMs or physical on-premises machines. Autoscaling starts up or down new containers as per needed.
5. Kubernetes helps you run your containerized applications reliably. If one node in a multi-node cluster fails, the workload is redistributed to others without disrupting availability to users.  It allows you to do rolling updates to your software without downtime.
6. Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes can load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.

### Docker vs Kubernetes
**Docker**
  - It is a platform and tool for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. 
  - Focuses on the individual container lifecycle, including creating, deploying, and running containers.
  - Suitable for developing and testing applications in isolated environments.
  - Easier to learn and use for beginners.
  - Suitable for simple applications and development workflows.
  - Ideal for local development, testing, and smaller-scale deployments.
  - Use Docker Compose for multi-container applications on a single host.

**Kubernetes**
   - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
   - Focuses on managing clusters of containers, ensuring that applications run smoothly across many nodes.
   - Suitable for production environments where automated management and scaling are crucial.
   - Steeper learning curve due to its complexity and extensive feature set.
   - Suitable for complex, large-scale applications requiring robust orchestration and automation.
   - Ideal for production environments, especially those requiring high availability, scalability, and complex orchestration.
   - Manages applications across multiple hosts and cloud environments.
