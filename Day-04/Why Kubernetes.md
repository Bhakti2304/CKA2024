## Why Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that schedules and automates the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications (microservices).
- Kubernetes services provide load-balancing and simplify container management  on multiple hosts.

### Benefits: 

1. Kubernetes automatically provisions and fits containers into nodes. Kubernetes container's orchestration avoids repetitive processes and inefficient administration with fewer servers.
2. Kubernetes clusters allow the simple and accelerated migration of containerized applications from on-premises infrastructure to hybrid deployments across any cloud provider’s public cloud or private cloud infrastructure without losing any of an app’s functions or performance.
3. Kubernetes services let you grow without needing to rearchitect your infrastructure. Hosting four apps on four virtual machines would generally require four copies of a guest OS to run on that server. Running those four apps in a container approach,though, means containing all of them within a single container where they share one version of the host OS.
